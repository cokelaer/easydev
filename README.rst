The  `easydev <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/easydev/>`_ package 
provides miscellaneous functions that are repeatidly used during 
the development of Python packages. The goal is to help developers on 
speeding up their own dev. It has been used also as an incubator for other 
packages (e.g., http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colormap) and is stable.

.. warning:: I'm not pretending to provide universal and bug-free tools. The
    tools provided may also change. However, **easydev** is used
    in a few other packages such as 
    `bioservices <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bioservices>`_, 
    `sequana <https://sequana.readthedocs.io>`_ or 
    `GDSCTools <https://sequana.readthedocs.io>`_ to give a few
    examples.
