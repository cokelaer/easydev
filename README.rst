**easydev** is a package I use for the development of other software available on pypi.
It provides utilities that are of general usage for the development of Python packages. 


For instance, it provides the
sphinx templates being used for this documentation. It is also used by
other packages where documentation using Sphinx is being used (e.g., rtools, 
spectrum). It provides tools such as multisetup (to ease the development of
several packages within a single namespace), get_share_directory of any package,
functions that are used often such as type checking...

In addition, common tools are provided. For instance, convertor to different color 
representation (e.g., RGB, HSV).

Similar projects are pytools, pytoolbox.

For a full documentation, see the sphinx documentation at
`<http://pythonhosted.org/easydev/>`_
